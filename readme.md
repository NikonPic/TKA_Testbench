# Validation of a Robotic Testbench for Evaluating Biomechanical Effects of Implant Rotation in Total Knee Arthroplasty on a Cadaveric Specimen

>In this study, we developed and validated a robotic testbench to investigate the biomechanical compatibility of three total knee arthroplasty (TKA) configurations under different loading conditions, including varus-valgus and internal-external loading across defined flexion angles. The testbench captured force-torque data, position, and quaternion information of the knee joint. A cadaver study was conducted, encompassing a native knee joint assessment and successive TKA testing, featuring femoral component rotations at -5°, 0°, and +5° relative to the transepicondylar axis of the femur.

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we developed and validated a robotic testbench to investigate the biomechanical compatibility of three total knee arthroplasty (TKA) configurations under different loading conditions, including varus&ndash;valgus and internal&ndash;external loading across defined flexion angles. The testbench captured force&ndash;torque data, position, and quaternion information of the knee joint. A cadaver study was conducted, encompassing a native knee joint assessment and successive TKA testing, featuring femoral component rotations at &minus;5&deg;, 0&deg;, and +5&deg; relative to the transepicondylar axis of the femur. The native knee showed enhanced stability in varus&ndash;valgus loading, with the +5&deg; external rotation TKA displaying the smallest deviation, indicating biomechanical compatibility. The robotic testbench consistently demonstrated high precision across all loading conditions. The findings demonstrated that the TKA configuration with a +5&deg; external rotation displayed the minimal mean deviation under internal&ndash;external loading, indicating superior joint stability. These results contribute meaningful understanding regarding the influence of different TKA configurations on knee joint biomechanics, potentially influencing surgical planning and implant positioning. We are making the collected dataset available for further biomechanical model development and plan to explore the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic platform for additional biomechanical analysis. This study highlights the versatility and usefulness of the robotic testbench as an instrumental tool for expanding our understanding of knee joint biomechanics.},
