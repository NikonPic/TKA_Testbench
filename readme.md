# Validation of a Robotic Testbench for Evaluating Biomechanical Effects of Implant Rotation in Total Knee Arthroplasty on a Cadaveric Specimen

>In this study, we developed and validated a robotic testbench to investigate the biomechanical compatibility of three total knee arthroplasty (TKA) configurations under different loading conditions, including varus-valgus and internal-external loading across defined flexion angles. The testbench captured force-torque data, position, and quaternion information of the knee joint. A cadaver study was conducted, encompassing a native knee joint assessment and successive TKA testing, featuring femoral component rotations at -5°, 0°, and +5° relative to the transepicondylar axis of the femur.
